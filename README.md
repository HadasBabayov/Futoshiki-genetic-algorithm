# Futoshiki-genetic-algorithm

To run the project -
You can see the code in futoshiki.py.<br/>

In input_files folder you have configuration files.<br/>

During the run three solutions will be printed (one for each algorithm).<br/>
At the end of the run two graphs will be printed, in one we will see the average of evaluations for generations and in the other we will see the best evaluation in each generation.
